# About Me

Hi, I'm MatÄ›j ÄŒÃ¡stek, a beginner programmer passionate about web development, game development, and learning new technologies. I started coding during high school and have been on a journey to improve my skills ever since. My focus is mainly on **Python** and **Pygame** for game development, but I'm also exploring other languages and frameworks.

## ðŸ’» Skills and Technologies:
- **Python**: My main programming language, used in many of my early projects, including game development and automation scripts.
- **Pygame**: I used Pygame to create simple 2D games, focusing on pixel art and interactive game elements.
- **Web Development**: Iâ€™m learning web development using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and exploring frameworks like **React**.
- **Version Control**: Familiar with **Git** and **GitHub** for managing my projects and collaborating with others.

## ðŸŽ® Projects:
- **Pixel Art Game (High School Project)**: My first game created using Python and Pygame. Itâ€™s set in an environment inspired by my high school, with interactive elements and a retro pixel art style. [Link to the project repository]([#](https://github.com/zacraide/pixelart)).
- **Web Development Projects**: Currently working on learning and building simple websites to improve my front-end and back-end skills. 

Feel free to reach out to me for collaboration, advice, or just to chat about programming!
